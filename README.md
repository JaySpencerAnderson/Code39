# Code 39 Barcode
## Generate barcode using the span HTML tag to generate the lines.  This thought came from Code Project

[The idea for this came from Code Project](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/146336/Creating-a-Code-39-Barcode-using-HTML-CSS-and-Java)

This web page generates some hard-coded Code 39 barcodes.  I got the idea of using the span
tag from the aforementioned article.  Otherwise, the implementation is mine.

This was a little effort to help out at work.
